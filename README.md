# Puma-Golf-Ball-Venture-Analysis
In this case study, Puma is looking to introduce a longer lasting, cut resistant golf ball to the market. Before we can proceed with this proposed business venture, we need data to help guide the company's decision. Statistical analysis is performed in order to help us move closer to a decision.

# Business Problem
Puma must decide if they should introduce a cut resistant golf ball to the market, or if they should discard the proposed business venture and look at other propositions. The company doesn't know if there is a statistical difference between the driving distance of the current ball that is on the market, and the new proposed ball. That is what we are trying to find out and where we'll start. The Puma Golf Ball Report Project PDF elaborates on the statistical findings as well as the business implications of our findings.
